Adventure game notes and ideas

Every time I make a blank tab a new route starts.

Idea 1: You wake up in a dark room with a man rambling about, he doesn't seem to notice you until you move, at which point he dashes towards you, tries to tell you something, asking a question you get a few choices in answers, but no matter what you want to say the gets dragged away by something in the dark. 
You hear the man screaming up until the moment you hear a door close and the lights turn on.
All alone in the room you must now find a way to escape. 
You notice a chain around your ankle, you can still move around, but you're anchored to a lock in the middle of the room, as long the chain is around your leg you're not gonna manage to leave the room. 

	You don't find a key and give up all hope of ever being found, you die of starvation, alone.

You find a key, and manage to unlock the chain, the key works on both sides of the chain, so you can take it with you if you want.
One of the tiles on the floor looks like it's loose, under it is a crowbar. You can pick it up to try and pry open the door.
If you take the chain with you you can easily wrap it around your body from shoulder to waist, and put the crowbar in between the chain and your waist, so you can easily take it with you.

	If you don't have the chain, you'll just have to hold the crowbar.
	Once the door opens you hear some clicking and a sharp object drops from the ceiling, heading your way.

		You don't respond to the clicking in time and something that looks like a scythe pierces your skin and digs deep into your stomach, the staff smashes against your head as the scythe doesn't stop, yanking you off your feet. In just mere seconds you find yourself pinned against the ceiling, impaled on the blade. Blood pours out your wound, killing you on the spot.

	You step away right in time, watching as a scythe is being launched from the ceiling, through the door, and into the ceiling on the other side. Someone is playing a sick game with you.

	You find yourself in a hallway of what looks like an abandoned hosppital or hotel, you can't really see the difference, because it's too dark.
	From where you are right now you can head in 2 directions, left or right.

		You decide to go left, seeing an open door at the end of the hallway with a light coming from it.
		You can choose to ignore it, and just go around the corner, go back to the room you were at to go the other way, or enter the new room.

			You ignore the door, heading around the corner, but as you turn around the corner, you trigger something.
			A light shines right into your face, blinding you as you hear a gate closing behind you. Unable to react in time the gate drops from the ceiling, trapping you inside, separated from the rest of the building, or at least the wing you were at.
			The big light shuts down, and the normal ceiling lights turn on. You can see a camera hanging from the wall with a blinking red light, it's on, someone is watching.
			You can either try to talk to the person behind the camera, hoping they can hear you and that they can talk back, or you can throw your crowbar at the camera to destroy it, sending a message to the one watching you.

				You try to talk, shouting at the camera, but you don't get a response. It only angers you, and you smash the camera with your crowbar, getting glass shards over your arm and in your face, one landing in your left eye.
				The shard isn't all that small, and you scream, trying to get the shard out of your eye, but only making it worse by doing so, rending your eye completely useless.

				Now bleeding from your eye and half blind you try to go on, there is only one way to go, and that is through a door in front of you. You open the door, and head inside. It's completely dark, but you can hear a voice, it greets you. 
				'I see you've decided to break my camera, I think you might end up regretting that in a bit. You see, I'm the one who took you to this place, I've decided to put you through a little test. Make it to the end, and you'll live. I'll even have an ambulance heading this way the second you enter the last room, but for that I need to see you.
				I have noticed that nothing motivates a person more than their own survival. So that is what we will test today, your motivation to live.
				In front of you, there are 2 boxes of which 1 contains something you need to survive, while the other will trigger a very painful way to die.
				which one do you think contains life, and which contains death? Take your time to decide.'

				The lights switch on while voice is talking to you, and you see the boxes. They're on their own little table, and don't look like anything special, but which one do you take?

					You go for the left one, hoping that it won't kill you when you open the box. However, hope doesn't get you anywhere. As at the moment you open the box you see a wire dropping down into the box, hearing a ticking. You turn the lid of the box over, to see a package of nails, and a blinking red light behind it, the blinking stops, and at that moment you see a flash as nails get blasted into your body, tearing your skin to shreds and going all the way through. The explosion caused by the package behind the nails, along with the nails rip you apart, turning you into nothing but a gory mess.

				You go for the right one, hoping that it won't kill you when you open the box, And you're in luck, finding a scalpel inside.
				'Good,' the voice says. 'You have dicided to live, but we're not done, yet. We've only just begun.' 
				A door on the other side of the room opens, and you head on through it.

				As you step through the door you trip over something, you turn around to see a woman standing over you, with what you can only describe as a spear. She looks at you in fear, and then turns to walk towards a corner, hitting her head against the wall while rambling something, you can make something out of her words. 'Too long. Gone. Escape. Weeks.' You try to get closer to her, but you hear the voice again. 'It seems you've met Alice. Unwilling to die, yet too afraid to keep going she's been here for days. The door will open, but only after one of you is dead. She has already killed, do you have what it takes to do the same?' She keeps leaning against the wall, but doesn't talk any more.
				One of you has to die, and you don't feel like being the one who dies, so you'll have to do something. You can try to talk to her, try to cut her with your scalpel, or try to hit her with your crowbar, whatever you're gonna do, you'd better do it fast.

						You try to talk to her, asking where she's from. But the only response you get is more rambling. You step closer to her, and try again. She turns around, but before you can respond she pushes you back to the ground, and slices the tip of your spear through your neck, slitting your throat. You try to crawl away, holding the wound with your hand, but she thrusts her spear through your stomach, impaling you to the ground.
						She turns back to her corner, and continues her ramblings as you die next to her.

					You decide to get it over with quickly and grab your crowbar to hit her in the head, but she can see you in the shadow, and turns around quickly to push her spear through your chest, piercing your heart. You drop your crowbar and stay in the same pose for a second, before slumping over onto the ground, as she pulls her spear out your chest again.

				Not really interested in dying you slowly walk up to her, without saying a word. You put your hand on her forehead, and your scalpel at her throat. She starts to cry. 'Please, no...' With one quick stroke you slice her throat open, and she just stands there for a little while, leaning against her wall, before dropping down onto her knees, and falling forward, onto her face, dead. 

				The door on the other side opens, and you enter another room. It looks like there is a big hole in the ground, with a little button somewhere hanging from the ceiling. There's also a camera, and microphone right next to you, as well as a speaker, maybe now you can finally talk to the person who brought you here. You see no harm in trying, so you sit down and start talking, the voice does respond. 'Glad to see you made it this far. I have a little challenge for you. By now you might have noticed the button and the gap. Your goal is to press the button, which will trigger a platform sliding out, so you can pass the gap. However, you'll need to use your items, and if you miss, you'll have to try again or risk a jump. But I wouldn't advise you to fall down, as the gap is basically a pool of acid. I doubt you'd be interested in melting alive in that stuff. Good luck.'

				You look at the button, it's too far away to reach, obviously. So you're gonna have to throw something at it. Look around, and maybe you'll find something, on the other hand, you still have your crowbar and scalpel with you.

					You unplug the microphone, and throw it, but you miss, and watch as the mic drops down into the pool of acid.

				You need to think of something else.
					
					You try to throw the speaker, but it's a lot harder to aim when you got only one eye.

				You need to think of something else.
				
					You try to throw the camera, and miss it by a mile.

				You need to think of something else.

					You try to throw the scalpel, hoping you can toss it hard enough for it to work, but it falls down into the acid.

				You need to think of something else.

					You try to throw the crowbar, but miss, because your aim isn't what it used to be.

				You've got nothing left to throw, so you pretty much only got one choice left. You decide to get a little distance between you and the gap, and get ready to run. Using the distance to get some speed going you run towards the gap, and try to jump across. You smack your body against the wall, but your arms are over the ledge, so you might just be able to pull yourself up. However, when hitting the wall, you also pierced your leg on a point. You need to let go with one arm to try and pull your leg free, and you almost succeed, but you slip.
				As your hand slips away you start screaming, pummeling down into the acid filled hole.
				You fall straight into the acid, trying to swim up and float, but it hurts too much. Your entire body is covered in the corrosive liquid, burning through your skin, reaching your muscles and bones. After minutes of screaming and crying you're unable to keep your head above the acid, and you go under. The acid seeps into your eye sockets, and through your ears. Via both your nose and your mouth it goes down your throat, eating away at you from the inside out. You slowly die, drowning in burning acid, a horrible death.
				
			You realize it's probably useless to even try and talk, so you take a little distance, and throw your crowbar right at the camera, breaking it. You pick your crowbar back up from the ground and move on.

			You enter a dark room, unable to see anything, but as you enter the room you are greeted by a voice through an intercom.
			'I see you've decided to break my camera, I think you might end up regretting that in a bit. You see, I'm the one who took you to this place, I've decided to put you through a little test. Make it to the end, and you'll live. I'll even have an ambulance heading this way the second you enter the last room, but for that I need to see you.
