	<p>Hello, player. You don't know me, but I know you. I want to play a game. <br> In this adventure game you choose your own path to follow. You will encounter puzzles and traps, all testing your will to live. <br> Live or die, the choice is yours.</p>
</div>
<div id="trap1"><p>
	You wake up in a room, with a chain around your neck, connected to a strange machine in the middle. <br> "Hello, Jason. As a car mechanic it is your job to solve problems and repair engines in exchange for money. <br> However, you repeatedly and deliberately did only half the amount of work you were paid for, forcing your customers to come back after a short while only to pry more money out of their pockets. <br> Did you even realize how many people were hospitalized because of your lackluster work? You may have noticed the chain around your neck, try to remove it. <br> I have hidden a key in this room, find it and unlock the padlock. But be quick, or the chain will pull you towards the engine and you will be killed by the very machine you claimed to have fixed."
