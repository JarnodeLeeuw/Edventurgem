	<p>Hello, player. You don't know me, but I know you. I want to play a game. <br> In this Saw-based adventure game you choose your own path to follow along various puzzles and traps from the Saw franchise, they will be testing your will to live. <br> While the characters on the pictures may change your character remains the same, the people you will see before you have taken similar paths, and act as your placeholders. Their fate is your own. <br> Live or die, the choice is yours.</p>

	"Hello, Jason. As a car mechanic it is your job to solve problems and repair engines in exchange for money. <br> However, you have repeatedly and deliberately done only half the amount of work you were paid for, forcing your customers to come back after a short while only to pry more money out of their pockets. <br> Did you even realize how many people were hospitalized because of your lackluster work? You may have noticed the chain around your neck, try to remove it. <br> I have hidden a key in this room, find it and unlock the padlock. But be quick, or the chain will pull you towards the engine and you will be killed by the very machine you claimed to have fixed."
